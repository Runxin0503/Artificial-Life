# Artificial Life

Welcome to **Artificial Life**! This project is a simulator of evolution in a 2D virtual environment, where artificial creatures evolve through interactions with plants, eggs, other creatures, and the environment itself. This simulator lets you create new simulations, run them over extended periods, and observe the complex behaviors that emerge as creatures evolve.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Evolution**: Creatures evolve through topology and weight-evolving artificial neural network (TWEANN), allowing for diverse and intricate topologies. This enables complex behavior patterns to emerge without external guidance, driven by a NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) genetic algorithm.
  
- **Continuous Simulation**: Unlike other simulators that end after a short period and retain only a handful of the best organisms, this simulation is designed to run indefinitely with potentially millions of births and deaths, creating a realistic evolutionary environment.
  
- **Sophisticated Creature Design**: Each creature features evolving body attributes like vision, digestion, armor, strength, and size. It may also develop tendencies to be herbivorous or carnivorous, allowing for a dynamic predator-prey ecosystem.

- **High-Performance Simulation Engine**: Leveraging optimized algorithms for collision detection and spatial partitioning, the engine is built for speed, enabling hundreds of thousands of ticks per second. Multi-threading ensures the simulation can run at an acceptable speed, supporting long, complex evolutionary runs.

## Implementation

### Neural Network (TWEANN) & NEAT
The neural network system took about 1.5 months to develop, starting from scratch. Implementing RT-NEAT (Real-time NEAT) presented its own challenges due to limited resources on NEAT specifics. This work involved extensive parameter tuning to ensure realistic, adaptive creature behavior.

### Simulation Engine
The engine was developed with spatial partitioning and collision detection algorithms tailored to handle a large population of dynamically sized entities. The simulation, which emphasizes speed, can run for billions of ticks, allowing it to observe the emergence of stable species and ecological dynamics dozens of times in a short period.

### Creature Anatomy and Evolution
The creatures have an evolving physiology, a functioning digestive system that adjusts for herbivory or carnivory, and various physical attributes that adapt over time. This imitation of evolution in both brain and body allows for rich diversity, including creatures with differing diets, strengths, and survival strategies.

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)
The GUI is the most sophisticated interface in this project, providing real-time visualizations of each creatureâ€™s vital stats, dynamic graphs, and a neural network visualizer. Key features include:
- Real-time neural network visualization
- Graphs tracking species traits over time
- Detailed creature inspection and adjustable settings for simulation speed
- Toggleable views for creature hitboxes, spatial partitioning grids, and vision cones.

The simulation setup allows you to save and load simulation states to pick up exactly where you left off.

## Future Plans

- **Player Control**: Currently working on enabling player control of specific creatures to interact with the evolving ecosystem directly.
- **Collision System Optimization**: Ongoing work on a more memory-efficient collision detection system to improve performance on resource-constrained systems.
